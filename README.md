## About this Game

This project was created during the **Global Game Jam 2025**.  
The Global Game Jam is a worldwide event where participants design and build a game â€” digital or analog â€” in just 48 hours.  

At the start of the jam, a secret theme is revealed which serves as the creative foundation. In 2025, the theme was **"Bubbles"**. From brainstorming ideas and designing the world to programming the core mechanics, the challenge is to turn concepts into a playable experience within a very short time.  

Unlike most teams, I worked on this project **solo**. It was a challenging but rewarding experience to take on all aspects of development â€” from concept to code â€” on my own. The focus was not on competition, but on experimenting, learning, and having fun while creating something unique.
